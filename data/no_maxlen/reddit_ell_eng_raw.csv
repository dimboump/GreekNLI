0292dfbdf8,"I 've always believed that taxation is a good thing ( we pay as much as 50 % in Australia , and I believe we 're eclipsed only by European countries ) but , if the taxation is too high of an average percentage , has possible draw backs on the motivation of workers to earn disposable income as they lose some freedom to spend fruits of their labour as they see fit .",ELL

0b857abde0,same goes for ghosts we dont know if they exist . . we dont know how they manage to manipulate energy in a way that its not detectable . . we literally dont know enough about physics to actually proved that they exist or not . . same goes for the dark energy lhc cant pick it up so with his mentality dark energy doesnt exist . .,ELL
0b857abde0,there are risks and there are stupid risks the mountain for the past 2 weeks was exploding almost every day it wasnt dormant and suddenly decided to wake up like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ObsOj9Q2Do ) one whoever told them that it was safe to go up there needs to get his ass sued,ELL
0b857abde0,well you cant pass a bill that wont do any good in the end now can you ... ruble since the first sanctions is rising and rising . . the economy of russia according with the world bank is also rising with a big growth despite having the sanctions . . so what good it will be to impost more sanction since the first wave which was the worst didnt do anything ?,ELL
0b857abde0,its not wrong they do accept him as the ruler regardless of what you say ( on which even russia has agreed that he needs to go after the war is done ) that is politics my friend russia has quite a lot of interest down there its not like they are denying what assad has done because they love him in the same category is me asking if obama will admit the thousands of people his drone buddies killed,ELL
0b857abde0,romania that had an almost 8.0 mg should be as dark as possible . . half of greece should be as dark as possible same goes for central and south italy all dark ... tenerife while it doesnt produce really big earthquakes it has Cumbre Vieja which has collapsed so many times creating tsunamis big enough that had lay waste on everything that is facing the atlantic in europe ...,ELL
0b857abde0,well you will be suprised how much business usa is doing with russia ( generally its on 10 to 15 billions per year and while its not much most of them deal on areas that usa needs mainly on the rocket engines and exchange of technology about rockets ) the problem is the pipeline directly bypass ukraine something that obama didnt want to cause ukraine was shutting down the pipeline and asking for compensations ... the sanctions on iran didnt do much good either since neither japan or the asia in general nor europe followed in reality the money iran will spend in airbus alone is enough to flip the americans off and so is what they did i mean the only thing usa actually did on that case it to not let iran to buy directly from usa and since europe is a lot closer well . . ( i mean the deal iran had with boeing is literally the 75 % of boeings operating income somedays i just cant help thinking if this is a retaliation from trump given how he hated the inflation boeing did to upgrade the presidential and the navy aircrafts . . ),ELL
0b857abde0,gdp alone doesnt mean squat http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/russia/publication/rer as you can see russian economy despite what the `` media '' is saying is actually growing faster than it was before the sanctions ... also that notion of having `` an army rusting '' is just stupid ... whoever thinks that russia since 2003 and after is just sitting on their asses and doing nothing needs to wake up and see what is going on ...,ELL
0b857abde0,see when im talking with number i always can back it up . . the c variant is almost 6000 pounds heavier it has a bigger wing span and can carry 1500 pounds LESS fuel than the A variant plus it needs to reserve 30 % of its fuel for potential go arounds on sea plus the C will most likely carry external bombs as well so add to that a very increasing drag . . its not as simple as you might think ... [ and i know this how ?,ELL
0b857abde0,] ( http://csbaonline.org/research/publications/airsea-battle-concept/ ) the threat to the tankers exists from the moment that both russia and china developed pak fa and j20 reds never have anything more than cgi unless they changed only on this occassion and since we dont know shit about this scenario its most likely that they didnt had i said the proposed armament not what it carries now as a prototype half of what its going to get its a rip off of russian guided bombs and ATS missiles ah yeah i mistook it with the monstrocity of PAK TA what you mean shtorm goes by many names ?,ELL
0b857abde0,you cant possibly suggest that because they had several projects it means that they will all fall into the same category especially when almost all of them dont have anything to do with shtorm apart from being carriers . . actually they have built quite a lot of stuff since 2009 but anyways we know they gon na built it on sevmash its the only logical solution since it has the capacity ( initially the dry docks were created to handle 120.000 tons ships before the final design of their carriers came to be ) but they dont have the logistics for it,ELL
0b857abde0,no its actually very simple once you get to know what you are looking for its a well known exercise that literally nothing has changed since millions of years we know for example that they did release ROE when the su30mki were there we know that they do release the weapons types available we know that they do release the threat profiles we do know that they ( eventually ) release the third party support they had ( pods and stuff ) we do know that the 64 aggr is using f16 block 32 the absolute lowest and bare version of f16 that ever existed we do know that the reds can rely ONLY on CGI ( and given the ability of the f22 and f35 to blind them well lets say they are a non player ) to guide them while the blues can use awacs and whatever else they can bring this number is the same as back in vietnam era where we can see similiar numbers against mig21s and 17s simulated by f4s but in reality we dont have anything to compare this number because simply they didnt release anything this time but even if the f35 had a gazzilion problems we will never find out no one would love to have their 100 million per unit aircraft on news for bad stunts the same shit we saw on DACT http://aviationintel.com/in-response-to-reports-of-simulated-f-22-raptor-kills-by-german-eurofighters/ BUT BUT but ... something sneaky happened and a serious website actually managed to talk to a fighter pilot that was actually on the red flag this year !,ELL
0b857abde0,and as i said to the other guy usaf has yet to release a statement on the role of the f22s on the scenario we know they were escorted by 4f22s and if they were blinding the whole sky in order for the f35 to get strike kills then no that KDA is as usefull as me saying north korea will launch a missile that will actually HIT something,ELL
0b857abde0,i wont be suprised if * they faked his death * he faked his death ( in both cases because probably he knew that he was next on someones list ) either way he did caused quite a lot of trouble for both sides with his decisions ... but https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9k05CbXmqE&amp;t he had style,ELL
0b857abde0,f35 and f22 have a combat radius of 600 MAX not 1200 unless they ferry till the target and go all kamikaze on them so effectivelly this means 300km from the nearest tanker perhaps a more [ detailed analysis of the situation will help you understand ] ( http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/7012/the-air-force-desperately-needs-a-stealth-tanker ) also no in the recent red flag as far as i can remember they did say they had a big score BUT till today ( well a week ago the last time i searched ) they STILL HAVENT provide a single statement on what was the role of the f22s in that said scenario that is why i never trust ANYTHING that comes from the mouth of people involved in politics kc-z isnt due to mid/late 30s and the cbars since the MIL C is keep delaying ( now on 2019 than 2017 ) i really really REALLY doubt we will see it before 2025 . . j20 and a variant of pak fa is the very definition of stealth bombers . .,ELL
0b857abde0,actually no f35 is a political aircraft and nothing more u.s has a really BIG problem when it come on its air force and they wont have any solution till 2040 ... they literally dont have any concept for a stealth air tanker and if they ever go against a decent opposite force that can hold its own their current tankers are just a big sitting duck plus they will have to stay a lot further out from the AA range of the enemy resulting on artificially decreasing the combat radius of their stealth fighters literally taking their advantage and shoving it into the ground . . ( there is a reason as to why both russia and china are developing fighters and bombers with specific characteristics ),ELL
0b857abde0,the maximum radius on ferry is 1110 km on the c variant the maximum on a typical payload is 833km on the b variant A is just retarded version so no one cares about that yeah but as i said when you give one team a big advantage of having an awacs while the reds gets cgi you cant really say `` look at the score '' i mean YOU made the f35 to blind spec the enemy cgi so that others can strike without a problem unless this was the scenario and they just failed to mention it . . well in order for them to be threatened they need to actually get in combat with a decent enemy first i highly doubt usa will go to war with anyone remotely close to their level for so many reasons . . the milestone c is delayed as far as they told the press but no reasons given china refers to j20 as a bomber helps that the proposed armament is 90 % air to surface missiles and some conventional bombs and only 2 short to mid distance ATA missiles pak da wasnt even a russian desing it was a fan made video as for shtorm pretty sure it came on 2011 . . initially they had plans for 13 now its 6 plus some new sub design that will use only supercavitating torpedoes ( saw it on themess.net ),ELL
0b857abde0,what im trying to say is that this became news ( again ) because they are blaming russia with as always zero to none evidence check this out to see how insignificant those readings are http://www.criirad.org/balises/CRIIRAD_170214%20_I131_Europe_Radioactivite.pdf http://www.criirad.org/english/presentation.html also check this out http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/radiation_safety_watchdog_hunts_source_of_radioactive_iodine_tagged_in_air_samples/9261478 back from october and yet it didnt got to the mainstream media if you can guess WHY it never made it to the news you will win a cookie :P,ELL

7dd6524f6a,"So , if I am a rich man and I want to be richer , or at least stay as rich as I am now , I would support a progressive taxation , because a flat taxation would make it more likely that a devastating revolution takes place and then we are all doomed .",ELL

7dd6524f6a,"It is true that a lot of money has been earned thanks to Greece taking loans , paying back with interest and taking new loans , but I am not sure that either of the following is true : - that in case of Greek default German and French banks have still made up their cost through all those years ' loan doses which * were * paid off , - that the increase of German and French ( and other governments ' ) exposure to Greek debt that took place during the bailout plan is justified only in terms of saving some banking sectors from significant damage and not for major political reasons , such as the integrity , well-being and longevity of EU which experienced giant shocks during the first decade of its life and wants to prove to all that it can absorb shocks of whatever magnitude .",ELL

7dd6524f6a,"I think there are 2 likely reasons for the timing of the report : - Either IMF and Lagarde want to somehow fortify themselves expecting a legal attack on behalf of Greece if it is kicked off EZ ( and perhaps even if kept inside , at a later time ) because according to IMF 's internal rules it should not support unsustainable debts , threatening even its own existence , - Or it was simply a way of applying pressure to EU and Merkel because IMF ( without consulting USA ) estimated that Greece was determined to not sign something that does not solve the debt problem and a Grexit was undesirable for IMF .",ELL
7dd6524f6a,"The fact that Varoufakis did something towards this direction while his political opponents apparently did not while they were in charge is politically very relevant and hot because the former governments have to defend their ( apparent ) choice of leaving Greek banking system unfortified and unable to deal with capital controls , lack of liquidity or even monetary switch , so instead of purely defending they found an opportunity to counter attack .",ELL

7dd6524f6a,"I mean , Greece has army at the borders with Bulgaria but the fact is not considered a threat for EU because this is how things have always been , but if there was no army there and suddenly Greece or Bulgaria moved army there and people took notice , it would have consequences .",ELL

e32aac4ecb,I can say a few things about Greece.We had been subjugated for more than a millenia ( Romans then Ottomans ) .

e3cd69cefd,No more talking here.You cant even understand what i am saying.I am not saying that all is Europe 's fault.It 's Greece falso too.The bild etc harmed your mind so fucking hard that your brain is just typing `` IT 'S GREECE 'S FAULT '' when you touch the keyboard .,ELL
e3cd69cefd,How the hell can you refuse to pay something?Who told you that?If you dont pay your loan they will take your home.If you dont pay the IRS you will go to jail.The thing is that many CAN NOT pay because we have freaking 27 % unemployment and the minimum wage is clearly not enough because of the high taxes you mentioned .,ELL
e3cd69cefd,"Actually , thats what i am talking about.We reached a point where if IMF keep having this attitude they wont take their money back.It doesnt matter how much surplus you have if you take depressed measures every 6 month.At the end you will have 50 % unemployment and 3 % surplus.You will litteraly destroy the economy ( it is already destroed ) to take one part of the money back until the country say byebye.The greek dept will be completely get back to you in decades ( maybe more ) . This will keep on going for years .",ELL
e3cd69cefd,You mean that a lot of people will die because Greece imports 70 % of needed products.Greece can solve problems if there are reforms that actually help the economy ( we dont even have taxmen right now ) and a restructuring of the dept.Otherwise Grexit or Europe is the same.People will die .,ELL
e3cd69cefd,"So now after so many years i dont produce enough but in the same time i dont have the money to produce.Thats why i am poor.Because i dont have money and so i dont have production.Even if someone has money believe me he wont start producing anything because of the high VAT + other taxes that increase the possibility of money loss.Thats why we are fucking `` screaming '' Moreover i never claimed that i want to live like a German or borrow money.First of all , i love hanging out until the morning spending my money on whiskeys.I dont understand why u are so mad.I didnt want to borrow money from the very begging.I had aa idiot prime minister and some stupid european faggots that forced me .",ELL

e3cd69cefd,So why are u crying for being poor?You are not.You havent seen how is to be poor so stop being mad.I used to live in this [ city ] ( http://www.world-of-waterfalls.com/europe-edessa-waterfalls.html ) . I ve seen people killing them selves at the waterfall because of poverty.People that i used to know .,ELL
e3cd69cefd,The economy can not stand these measures.People are willing to pay more just to stay inside the euro but u are Greek like me and u know that after a while they will start flaming the institutions again for the measures and for lossing their jobs etc screaming that they can not live like that ...,ELL
e3cd69cefd,The real problem is that the beautiful places are the mainstreat places.If you go further inside you will see the real poverty and that is what the Turks must demand.A slow reconstruction everywhere and not only at the places that tourists go.This is my opinion of course and i dont know if they can do it because the city is huge ...,ELL
e3cd69cefd,"The problem wont be only European and i am pretty sure that in Europe they know very well that the casualties from a Grexit can not be calculated.The GPD loss ( even if it 's small ) , the market 's reaction , the imports-exports that will be lost , the decrease of the world 's trade rate because lets not forget that Greece is the second largest shipowner , the geopolitical issue is important too ... these are only a few casualties that noone can calculate their cost and thats why there are huge differences between the theories about the Grexit cost .",ELL
e3cd69cefd,"Yeah ... tell me know that your country wouldnt do the same.Tell me something , how can you register someone that literally doesnt talk?Many of them if they are not Syrians the only thing that they say is `` Germany '' .

e3cd69cefd,Believe me ... you cant say the world `` same '' for every party when you compare them to PASOK and ND.They took billions euros of the people.I really prefer to die than to see them rule again.I dont give a fuck anymore about EU.I know that my country is in depression and will be for many more years.Sooner or later i will have to migrate or i will die from hunger .,ELL
e3cd69cefd,For some reason in Russia you dont learn english.In my free time i like to play 1 game of Dota ( its a videogame ) which is full of russians and they dont have a clue.The only phrases they say is `` obama banana '' and `` fuck you '' .,ELL
e3cd69cefd,"Even the older people do not but maybe they didnt do their homework when they were younger :P . My point is that in Greece we dont learn english at school ( the level is really low ) . There are private teaching schools ( there are too expensive but everyone goes there ) . They teach you purposeful english just to take 1-2 degrees.In my opinion thats bad too ... look at me.Its hard for me to communicate confortably.Also , in my university at the first 4 semesters there is a lesson `` english for economists '' ( i study economics ) . You dont have any kind of this in Russia ?",ELL
e3cd69cefd,"i didnt say the opposite ... but the question `` this guy still has a job '' sticked to my mind.I study economics and i ve seen his work ( 1 part until now ) and i can not accept that this guy who actually just hates Greece dared to talk like this for Krugman without having any clue not only about economics , but about Krugman too .",ELL
e3cd69cefd,"The pensions ' cut that was done at 2012 is uncostitutional and i dont know how we will get away from the law.Moreover , most pensioners can barerly survive.They also want to raise the drugs ' VAT from 6 to 12 % , the electrisity frm 13 % to 23 % and the food to an anknown persentage.Oldpeople wont survive ... their pensions is cut by 40 % already .",ELL
e3cd69cefd,Well ... i guess the vocabulary.The variety of words in Greek language is huge ... we dont learn most of them.However this is a benefit ( every word gives a different sense even if the meaning doesnt change ) for poems etc and thats why when i see a greek poem translated i feel depressed because i feel that the meaning is not the same .,ELL
e3cd69cefd,Maybe all europeans flame syriza but unfortunately its the best we have.ND was destroying and was looting the country for 40 years ( with PASOK that thx god is at 3 % now ) . Only the people that had/have benefits from them vote them.The other parties just dont exist .,ELL
e3cd69cefd,Raising the unemployment even more wont give u back your money.Your answer is so simplistic.You think cutting pensions and in long-terms wages to private sector will help greece to pay you back.No dude ... that means that even less people will be able to pay taxes and the income of the country will be decreased even more .,ELL
e3cd69cefd,"Dude , i dont understand what is your point.If you dont see that many kids are getting used in the religious way of life that probably wouldnt if they werent forced then you are living in another planet.Enough with this retarded conversation ... > I was baptised does n't affect my life at all .",ELL
e3cd69cefd,"Both proposals just suck.It 's the end boys.It is good , it is submissive ( maybe some of you will get erections ) but we wont be able to stand it.I really want to see the predictions of the IMF for the unemployment etc. . . if they have any .",ELL
e3cd69cefd,"there was a graph before 1-2 weeks here with IMF 's predictions about Greece ... both predictions for memorandums were really bad.Moreover , in order to create a surplus in the second memorandum the country stop paying the citizens.For example they owe 30.000 euros to my father and he just had 2 bookshops.And lets dont mention that they wanted more austerity measures this January and thats why the government felt .",ELL
